            <p>
                The Cloud Cuckoo Land

                It is the dream that the best of all dreams
                Like burning heart,
                finding it flames
                The cloud cuckoo land
                slide in my mind
                That if i live there
                everything is mine
                Is it cornocupian place?
                Abundant of golden vase
                Hope even the love is
                inexaustible place
                But it just chasing bubbles face
                i want to cross the rubicon
                Take the plunge and no return
                Drink from the waters of lethe
                For that i'll forget to breathe.
                Oh why you keep dwelling in me Cassandra?
                How can i reach the dream of dreams i
                know everything is in my hand
                But i don't know where i have to land
                i want to find the cloud cuckcoo land. <br/><br/>
